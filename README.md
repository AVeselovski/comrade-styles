# COMRADE-STYLES

## What is?

CSS library for use in my projects. Somewhat influenced by Botstrap 4.

## Why?

For fun & learning, mostly. Also hopefully to eventully save time with "bootstrapping" new projects UI.

## Installation

`npm install comrade-styles`

## Usage

Import in project's *SCSS* to get access to variables:

```scss
@import "~comrade-styles/scss/comrade";
```

Place desired variable overrides *before* above import.

#### OR

If no need for variables, just import compiled *CSS*:
```js
import 'comrade-styles'
// OR
require('comrade-styles')
```

#### Variables for theming are here:

`scss/utils/_config.scss`
