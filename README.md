# TOVARISH-CSS

## What is?

CSS library for use in my own projects. Somewhat influenced by Botstrap 4.

## Why?

For fun & learning, mostly. Also, hopefully to eventully save time with "bootstrapping" new projects UI.

## Installation

`npm install tovarish-css`

## Usage

SCSS (to be able to override variables):

```js
import 'tovarish-css'
// OR
require('tovarish-css')
```

Just the compiled CSS:

```js
import 'tovarish-css/css'
// OR
require('tovarish-css/css')
```

### Overrides:
